JSAPI is an independent implementation of the JSAPI 2 standard. It provides a basic framework that can be used for a JSAPI 2 compliant access to speech engines. Demo implementations support FreeTTS, Sphinx 4, Microsoft Speech API 5.4 and the Mac OSX speech synthesizer.

Note that the framework is still under development and needs more work to be really compliant to the standard.
